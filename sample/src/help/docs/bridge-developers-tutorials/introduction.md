### 1. Introduction
<br>

In this set of toturials we will show how to create an Aurelia plugin as an interface to a UI library. We call this type of plugin a **bridge**. The UI library used to demonstrate the development of a bridge is [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/).

Starting with the standard **[Aurelia Skeleton plugin](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-plugin)** project, we will follow the same "story" that starts in the **[Application developers tutorials](#/help/docs/app_developers_tutorials/1._introduction)** from the point of view of the Aurelia plugin developer.
<br>

In other words, this article presents the **overview** of the ways to create and extend the **[Aurelia-Materialize-Bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-bridge)** project.

You may find the note **[Bridge utilities](#/help/docs/bridge_developers_notes/2._bridge_utilities)** to be an interesting complement to this article as it shows some problems we've come across, along with their solutions.

#### Important notes

The whole section named **Bridge developers tutorials** is intended solely to new bridge projects contributors - a lot narrower class than people interested **App developers tutorials** dedicated to all Aurelia application developers that want to use Materialize components in their app.

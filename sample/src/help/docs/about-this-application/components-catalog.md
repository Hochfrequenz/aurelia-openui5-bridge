### 3. Catalog of Materialize controls as Aurelia components.
<br>
This is the most likely fashion this application is being used. Invoked via URL: **<a href="http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/aurelia-materialize-catalog">http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/aurelia-materialize-catalog</a>** the application renders the view shown below, which shows an overview of components provided by this bridge.

#### 2.1 Browsing the catalog

The click on **Components** menu item (as shown on Image 1 above) results in showing the Aurelia Materialize bridge components overview. Clicking on one of the components, a sample page is shown, containing a basic use example and more insteresting options along with a **side-nav navigation** on the left edge, showing the other available components.

That **side-nav** mimics the side-nav of [Materialize website](http://materializecss.com/) to be easy recognizable by Materialize users.

#### 2.2 Browsing the catalog's code sections
<br>
Each of the page showing a Materialize control converted to an Aurelia component, has a section that shows the usage of the component (the consumer's **view**) along with optional **view model** and css options.

Here are three consecutive screen-shots showing that information for the select control.
